""Regarding the text to pay, that is how we did our billing last month. Because we have over 400 bills we send out it is very time consuming to have to text every patient individually. We were able to do this with our previous system as well. We were told we would be able to use the function of having weave know everyone's balances and click one button to send anyone with a balance a text request, saving us quite a bit of time. Honestly it was one of the selling points of weave to us so it is very disappointing that now we are being told that this is not a feature offered with Dentrix Ascend. If we were being sold on the program and features I would think that Tanner wouldn't have told us about features if we were not able to use them. 

 

The waitlist feature has to have us manually add people, we really need something that would pull up a list of patients who are due for cleanings and not scheduled and then be able to send a mass text message for last minute openings. The only other feature I see is on lists the overdue patients, but even with that you have to send individual messages. 

 

When trying to send out a email campaign I tried to create a filter to send this only to patients who are overdue but when I click the drop down box for appointment type it only has the notes that are written in appointments and not procedures that someone would be due for. I also tried filtering it by last seen date and every time I save the filter it then brings me back to the filter page where my filter doesn't show up. I then go back to the campaign which brings me back to create the filter which says it saves and doesn't. I have gone in circles with this. The doctor is not happy because with our previous system we were able to fill last minute cancellations within minutes and now since we have had Weave we have had quite a few openings that we have not been able to fill. We have had to go back to printing recare reports and calling/texting people one by one taking up a lot of our employees time. 

 

We understand that it is a new partnership with Weave and Dentrix Ascend, but we are feeling a bit like this whole thing was a bait and switch. We were promised all of these great features but it seems that the most important ones to us are not working/available to us because of Dentrix Ascend. ""

 

As a recap, they're upset about the following:

 

Felt mislead about being told before onboarding started that they could use the collection list to request payments from patients but Dentrix Ascend doesn't integrate that data at this time. They did not the manual workaround me and @Sydney Samuels​ offered and found it inefficient.
 

In Dentrix, we are pulling the appt types from the appt descriptions instead of the appointment types themselves, which are messing with their auto reminders and online scheduling from working properly which is putting a tremendous strain on patients and staff.
 

The product limitation with having to manually text quicklist or overdue patients when there's an opening instead of the system automatically doing it for you.",,,3

- Only syncs once nightly, causing outdated scheduling info.
- Scheduling feature doesn’t work properly (can’t pull providers correctly, external scheduling shows all time blocks inaccurately). Chris notes online scheduling was the main draw for choosing Weave, but it doesn’t meet their needs.

Suggested a downgrade to Weave’s “Phones & Basics” bundle ($199/month) to save money and retain phones, fax, texting, mobile app, and chat.

Chris is unsure the owners will be interested:
- They already have their own PBX server and SIP trunking provider.
- Dr. Anderson feels misled in the initial setup but still agrees to present the option.

Chris confirms they plan to transition back to Flow Route (previous SIP provider). Tentative porting date: Sept 14–15.",Desired Features,Desired Features,3

She also mentioned that they need a feature where if someone calls in and are on a current call it will roll over to the other line for someone to grab. Their previous carrier did that and she stated they need that.
They will be going back to Vine as they have had to go back already due to the 10DLC issues and a local carrier for their phones, she didn't have the name at the time, my guess is a landline company due to the call rollover.

James explained that Weave is a good tool, but it doesn’t integrate with their EHR (Unified Practice). They are planning to switch EHRs and didn’t want to pay for Weave during this transition, especially since it required manual data transfers and didn’t increase efficiency.

Lack of Integration:
Weave’s inability to auto-sync patient data or directly integrate with their current systems limited its usefulness. Features like direct texting and dashboard tools were not fully functional due to these integration issues.

Phone Services:
They didn’t use Weave for phones and already have a phone system that handles basic communication and compliance. Any future phone system would need full integration with their new EHR.

They're considering Athena as a new EHR. I let them know that Weave does have contact sync with Athena, which could improve syncing and functionality.",Consolidating Under PMS,Cost Savings / Duplication of Services,3

I would like to end my service with Weave. Like I shared with you the other day, I found out that I can get VOIP phone service through my current company that I have my patient recall, reviews, forms, etc. already. When I signed up with Weave, I was misled by the sales person who told me that Weave is the only company that provides VOIP phones, patient recall, etc all inclusive. I was disappointed in the brief onboarding training process, and felt not enough time was spent in explaining the set up. Now that I have finally figured things out by myself, with the help of customer service (that has not always provided me with accurate information), I have discovered that Weave does not offer the option for individualized text and/or email recall as a blended option for patient communication preferences. Having to use all text, or all email without individualized choice is really a huge disadvantage in our practice. My current system allows for that and it is great.",,,3

- Failed to properly explain important features like call intelligence
- Lacked detailed instructions and guidance

2. Inadequate technical support:
- No clear answers about phone system issues
- Never provided explanations of what was wrong
- No solutions or ETAs for fixes
- Kept saying ""we don't know"" and ""we're looking into it""
- Issues were escalated to tier 2 but problems remained unresolved

3. Phone system problems:
- Dropped calls
- Users unable to answer calls
- Non-functioning answer/ignore buttons
- Do Not Disturb button malfunctioning
- Issues affected both office and remote employees

Rob and I pitched value, and also spoke to his already incredibly low pricing ($217 Weave Core + Premium). Ryan has spoken to multiple other vendors and he claims they offer ""per user"" pricing. He runs 1-2 users per location, sometimes 3, so is looking at max bill of $20-$60. Submitted for save play pricing to FP&A, but never heard back. Multiple attempts from me and my TL to stir a response, speaking of timing being critical, but we didn't receive anything. Even made a channel with FP&A and directors and key stake holders. Ryan started attempting to port his numbers this same week without the PINS. I offered $149 for phones + missed call, call pop, fax. It was rejected.

Mark, who was on the call with Ryan, Rob and I, was a technical consultant of some sort. It appears he is involved in convincing Ryan to move services, and may be a contributor to this motion. Whether he receives kickbacks from providing his ""own"" solution is unknown, but it seems to be a possibility.

Ryan was also upset about being billed $6k instead of the normal $4k. Investigation showed it was double billing in the same month due to the billing changes at the start of the year.",Pricing,Lower Price,1

They also planned to solely use the mobile app rather than physical or softphones.
Once their numbers were ported over and they were able to experience the mobile app, they felt it was not a good solution for their business. Their reasoning was:
Calls/texts are intermittent (we have asked for examples of this to help troubleshoot to see if this is an actual programming error or if it is the nature of the mobile app - the office is unwilling to troubleshoot/provide examples & data. All testing and auditing on our end has shown call routing and texting numbers to be set up as expected.
""It's clear this system was designed for medical offices, and it's not really a good fit for sales""
All other reasoning pointed to frustration with issues they experienced, which are now resolved and outlined below
Events that escalated their frustration were few and quickly resolved, but included:
After porting, calls were going straight to voicemail as call groups did not include any devices. They were instructed (at the beginning of the process) to either add the necessary user's mobile apps to the desired call groups before porting, or to send us a list of which users should be included so we could set this up for them, but neither option occurred until they reached out to let me know they weren't receiving calls.
After porting, instruction sets were not updated with the labels for 6 of their numbers that had ported. This was quickly resolved once the error was found due to the report of calls going to the wrong location.
They reported that texts were going to ""all users"" or to the wrong location, or being sent with the wrong number/receiving messages from random numbers, but they were unable to provide specific examples of this. I tested every location that had a ported number set up, and all outbound texts were successful (with the right number) and inbound texts were successfully received to the proper account.
Items we have identified on our end that may have helped the transition go more smoothly:
Porting occurred on the main Weave account as all of their numbers were on the same account with RingCentral, which allowed more opportunity for errors in provision. The numbers had to be manually moved to the proper location on each port day, which is how the instruction sets were missed for a few lines.
We should have followed up on the call groups to confirm devices were included before the port day - including mobile users having logged into the app to create their SIP profile.",,,3

- Incorrect labeling of their call group (“OSAIS” instead of “Oasis”), which couldn’t be fixed despite tickets.
- Inability to access support tickets due to login errors.
- Outbound calls from the Weave mobile app appeared as another company (OCA Behavioral).
- OCA’s calls were wrongly routed to Oasis’s Philippines-based virtual assistant.
- OCA’s number showed as spam, causing critical telehealth calls to be ignored.
- Michaels personal cell number was added for business calls, leading to privacy breaches (e.g., patients calling him for prescriptions).
- Poor onboarding and no support during setup, resulting in business downtime and lost productivity.

Dr. Nawbi (also from Oasis) joined later and expressed strong frustration:
- Called the experience “the worst I’ve ever seen”.
- Stressed that they were “abandoned after signing” and left to figure things out themselves.
- Demanded a full refund of $884 and made it clear they are not interested in continuing with Weave.
- Threatened legal action and public complaints if not resolved fairly.

I repeatedly apologized and took accountability for the poor experience. Explained that a 30-day cancellation period is standard policy, mainly to ensure porting and device return is smooth.

I offered escalation to a dedicated technical team (not general support). I reminded the office that they did sign a contract with us, and I'll look into it, and if there's anything we can do. 

AE was also on the call and apologized for the offices experience. He said he wishes the client had reached out to him directly. 

Michael clarified that he may not have communicated clearly and was in touch with someone else. 

Travis and myself said we could still be a contact post-sale. Expressed regret that things went downhill after the initial excitement.",Customer Experience,Onboarding,3

Aurora expressed dissatisfaction with our services to date and confirmed that they would like to cancel effective today. She also mentioned that she attempted to reach out to her sales rep, @Alex Tarin​  multiple times with questions regarding the package and what was promised, but did not receive any response.

 

I apologized for the lack of follow-up and asked if she would consider staying if I escalated the issue to both my manager and Alex's manager for immediate resolution. However, she declined, stating they are firmly set on canceling.

 

Additionally, Aurora shared her opinion that Weave does not integrate well with Eaglesoft, which further contributed to their decision.",,,3

- A confusing and tedious onboarding process
- Lack of hands-on support during phone system setup
- Rude and unhelpful customer support
- Issues with cordless phone setup and inadequate tech support
- Tickets were closed without resolution or communication. Never received a callback when promised. 
- Forms not syncing properly with Dentrix, and when they finally did, they input incorrect data
- Problems with insurance claim delays caused by incorrect syncing

Options we discussed:
- Downgrading to a “Phones & Basics” bundle to keep phone service.
- Support from a technical success team with fewer caseloads for more direct assistance
- Encouraged Rika to reach back out if the new setup didn’t meet expectations, offering future help",Customer Experience,Onboarding,2

- Her business has slowed down.
- She's no longer using Weave’s services.
- She switched to a HIPAA-compliant Google number for texting, which is more affordable.
- Her use of Weave was minimal, mostly just for texting, so continuing to pay $100/month isn’t justified.

Transition & Offboarding Details
- Since Elizabeth isn’t using Weave’s phones or phone numbers, there’s no equipment return or number porting involved.
- Reminded her to download any needed data (like past conversations) from the Weave system before July 24.
- We discussed other options, we can’t compete with Google’s pricing.

She hoped to be refunded the for invoice paid in June, but I explained that per company policy, Weave requires a 30-day transition period, and a refund was not approved by the finance team.

However, I told her if she's ready to be cancelled by July 24, we can do that, ensuring no further billing in August.",Value,Cost,3
